        Returns a list of action instances for a particular publish.
        This method is called each time a user clicks a publish somewhere in the UI.
        The data returned from this hook will be used to populate the actions menu for a publish.
    
        The mapping between Publish types and actions are kept in a different place
        (in the configuration) so at the point when this hook is called, the loader app
        has already established *which* actions are appropriate for this object.
        The hook should return at least one action for each item passed in via the 
        actions parameter.
        
        This method needs to return detailed data for those actions, in the form of a list
        of dictionaries, each with name, params, caption and description keys.
        
        Because you are operating on a particular publish, you may tailor the output 
        (caption, tooltip etc) to contain custom information suitable for this publish.
        
        The ui_area parameter is a string and indicates where the publish is to be shown. 
        - If it will be shown in the main browsing area, "main" is passed. 
        - If it will be shown in the details area, "details" is passed.
        - If it will be shown in the history area, "history" is passed. 
        
        Please note that it is perfectly possible to create more than one action "instance" for 
        an action! You can for example do scene introspection - if the action passed in 
        is "character_attachment" you may for example scan the scene, figure out all the nodes
        where this object can be attached and return a list of action instances:
        "attach to left hand", "attach to right hand" etc. In this case, when more than 
        one object is returned for an action, use the params key to pass additional 
        data into the run_action hook.
